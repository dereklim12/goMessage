# goMessage
Test messaging encoder/decoder in Go
The code reads a text file message.txt in the same directory and tries to match the message in binary to the headers in UTF8 characters. Development in progress as the first headers and messages can be decoded but I am having problem with the second set. This is my first project in Go and I am not familiar with the syntaxes, array handling and built-in functions. I can do better if given more time to explore the Go langange.
